# SQL-Projects

In this folder you will find each of my SQL projects. Each folder contains 2 files, the first one is the Database and the second one has some business questions and how I solved them using some queries.

## Maven Movies

**Situation:** My friend and I just purchased Maven Movies, a DVD rental business.

**The Brief:** As a new owner I will need to learn everything I can about the business: Product, inventory, staff,customer purchase behaviours. We have access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database.

**Objective** 

Use SQL to : 

- Explore Maven Movies Database
- Develop a film grasp of the 16 DataBase tables and how they relate to each other
- Analyze all aspects of the company's data, including transactions, customers, staff,etc.
